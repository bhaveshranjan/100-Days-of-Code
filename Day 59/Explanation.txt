Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Case 1: Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Case 2: Input: root = []
Output: []

Case 3: Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

case 1: Input: x = 4
Output: 2
case 2: Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1



class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int y = 1;
        int n = x;
        while (n > y) {
            n = y +  (n - y) / 2;
            y = x / n;
        }
        return n;
        
    }
};
